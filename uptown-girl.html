    <h2>Letra</h2>
<p>
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why
</p>

<p>
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
</p>

<p>
And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind
</p>

<p>
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
</p>

<p>
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
</p>

<p>
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win
</p>

<p>
And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine
</p>

<p>
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl
</p>

<p>
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
</p>

<p>
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
</p>
