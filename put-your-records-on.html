    Three little birds sat on my window
    And they told me I don't need to worry
    Summer came like cinnamon
    So sweet
    Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
    </p>

    <p>
    Maybe sometimes we've got it wrong, but it's alright
    The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
    Oh, don't you hesitate
    </p>

    <p>
    Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
    You go ahead, let your hair down
    Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
    Just go ahead, let your hair down
    </p>

    <p>
    You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
    </p>

    <p>
    Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
    Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
    (Just relax, just relax)
    Don't you let those other boys fool you
    Got to love that afro hair do
    </p>

    <p>
    Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's alright
    The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
    Don't you think it's strange?
    </p>

    <p>
    Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
    You go ahead, let your hair down
    Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
    Just go ahead, let your hair down
    </p>

    <p>
    You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
    </p>

    <p>
    'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
    Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
    When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
    Do what you want to
    </p>
    <p>
    Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
